Introduction
Through this project, we are aiming to use fetal health data to understand and classify the health of a fetus as Normal, Suspect or Pathological We are doing this using CTG (Cardiotocogram) data.

Classificaton of fetal health into these three criteria is of utmost importance as this helps reduce child and maternal mortality. As per The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, reduction of child mortality is a key indicator of human progress. The SDGs seek massive reductions in mortality ralte, and aim to have a a neonatal mortality rate of 12 or fewer deaths per 1,000 live births, and an under-five mortality rate of 25 or fewer deaths per 1,000 live births, by 2030. However, more than 5 million children died before their fifth birthday in 2020.

In a similar light, in lower-income and lower-resource areas, there is still a shocking number of deaths of the mother during, before, and after childbirth due to complications which could be preventable with some fetal moniroting and care. This leads to very high maternal mortality rate, but more importantly the preventable loss of countless lives. We aim to try and build a model to move closer to this important goal of reducing child and maternal mortality through classification of CTG data, our primary motivation in choosing this path for our project. CTG is an easy to use, low-cost, accessible option to get information about the health of a fetus, which allows healthcare providers to work towards diagnosis and choosing the right treatment path to reduce child and maternal mortality. CTG works by sending ultrasound waves in pulses to get data on fetal heart rate, uterine contractions, fetal movements, and more.

We plan on using the aforementioned data to classify the health of a fetus as Normal, Suspect or Pathological.
